3. I have been working as a QA engineer for more than a year. My next step is the development direction. Most of all, I like working in a friendly team, and I'm also good at explaining things to other people, teaching them something. That's why I want to be a team-lead in the future. I want to share my knowledge with others :) I also enjoy photography, video creation, guitar, and sports.
